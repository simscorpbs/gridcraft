//! Colour-match the window to the display, as other Mac apps' windows are (macOS).
//!
//! GridCraft draws sRGB colours, but the window it renders into isn't tagged with a colour space, so
//! macOS sends the values to the display unconverted and mid tones look lighter than in
//! colour-managed apps (#404040 text shows as 64 where a colour-managed window shows 49 on the same
//! screen). Tagging the window sRGB asks AppKit to convert it to the display's profile. A safe call
//! in the `objc2-app-kit` bindings (the workspace forbids unsafe). Ported from WordCraft.
